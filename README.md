Automate word or number guessing game

For example you need to guess a 7 letter word that the 2nd letter is "U" and the 6th letter is "E"
You just need put the U in the 2nd box and E in the 6th box and the app will scan the text file containing the words list and display the matching words.

Same process in number guessing game.
